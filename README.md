## TileMapLayer3D 🧩

**Version 0.7.0** - New Featue - ANIMATED TILES

- This feature works with a concept of a Animation Frame. A frame is not a single tile, it is a region of your tileset that can span multiple tiles. You select the entire area of your animation in the tileset, then tell the plugin how to subdivide it into frames using Rows and Columns.

- For example, if your tileset has a 2×2 waterfall texture that animates across 4 steps laid out horizontally, you would select the full 8×2 tile region and set: Columns = 4, Rows = 1, Frames = 4. Each frame will be a 2×2 block of tiles. The animation cycles through these frames automatically.

- How to use it:
1. Switch to Animated Tiles mode in the top toolbar
2. Select the full tile region in the tileset that contains all animation frames
3. Set Rows / Columns to define how the region is subdivided into frames
4. Set total frames to play (can be less than Rows × Columns to skip trailing slots)
5. Set Speed — playback rate
6. Click "New" to save the animation definition
7. Select it from the list and paint in the 3D viewport. Tiles animate immediately

**Version 0.6.0** - Multiple important updates and refactors.

UI Updates:
- Revamped UI: Left Toolbar is now the main toolbar; Bottom Toolbar becomes a Context Panel showing controls relevant to each mode
- TilePlacer Panel moved to the lower editor area for more texture display space
- New Zoom and Pan controls in the Tile Selection screen
- Mode switching now via Main Toolbar buttons on the left

New mode: Smart Select: Raycast-based tile selection that finds regular, rotated, and tilted tiles with precision. Includes three selection modes:
- Single Pick - Select individual tiles (additive — clicking more tiles adds to the selection)
- Connected UV - Selects all tiles on the same Grid Plane that share identical UV/texture
- Connected Neighbor - Selects all tiles on the same Grid Plane regardless of texture

Smart Select Operations:
- Delete - Remove/Delete all tiles in selection
- Replace UV/Texture - Replace selected tiles' texture with the current TileSet panel selection


**Version 0.5.0** - New UI, Toolbar and Data model (If you use versions before 0.4, this will break old scenes). Migrate to 0.4 first then to 0.5

**Version 0.4.0** - Major update with 3D mesh modes, SpriteMesh integration, and optimized storage.

Godot 4.5+ editor plugin for building 3D tile-based levels from 2D tilesheets. Heavily inspired by Crocotile3D but built directly into Godot.

## Tutorial and Auto-Tiling Setup Video

[![TileMapLayer3D - Tutorial Auto tiling overview](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZmxgWqF22-A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmxgWqF22-A)


## 🎯 Why I created this?

To help with creating old-school 3D Pixel art style games, or to leverage 2D tiles for fast level prototyping. 
You can create entire levels, or you can create reusable objects and assets using a Grid-based structure that offers perfect tiling.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- ✅ **Paint 3D levels from 2D tilesheets** — Import any tilesheet, select tiles, click to place
- ✅ **Multi-tile selection** — Select up to 48 tiles and place them as a group
- ✅ **18 orientations** — Floor, walls, ceiling + 45° tilted variants for ramps and slopes
- ✅ **Transform on the fly** — Rotate (Q/E), tilt (R), flip (F), reset (T)
- ✅ **Area painting & erasing** — Shift+Drag to paint/erase rectangular regions
- ✅ **Full undo/redo** — Every action reversible via Godot Editor

### New in v0.4.0
- ✅ **BOX & PRISM mesh modes** — Create 3D tiles with depth, not just flat quads
- ✅ **Per-tile depth control** — Adjust thickness of BOX/PRISM tiles (0.1 to 1.0)
- ✅ **Texture Repeat Mode** — Tile textures across BOX/PRISM depth surfaces
- ✅ **SpriteMesh generation** — Convert tile selections into standalone 3D mesh objects (original project https://github.com/98teg/SpriteMesh) (See Credits)
- ✅ **Flat tiles Backface painting** — Paint double-sided walls for interior/exterior rooms
- ✅ **Autotiling (Enhanced)** — Uses Godot's native TileSet for terrain painting
- ✅ **Optimized storage** — ~47% smaller scene files with automatic migration and external collision resource file save
- ✅ **Spatial chunking** — Better performance and dual chunck system for MultiMeshInstance3D (works by distance and total instance count)

### Export & Collision
- ✅ **Collision generation** — Automatic collision geometry for all mesh types
- ✅ **Binary collision export** — Save as .res for smaller files
- ✅ **Mesh baking** — Combine tiles into a single mesh for export
- ✅ **Scene persistence** — Close and reopen, tiles are still there

## 🧱 Mesh Modes

TileMapLayer3D supports four mesh types for different use cases:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **FLAT_SQUARE** | Traditional flat quad tile | Floors, walls, ceilings |
| **FLAT_TRIANGLE** | Flat triangular tile | Angled corners, slopes |
| **BOX_MESH** | 3D cube with configurable depth | Thick walls, platforms, blocks |
| **PRISM_MESH** | 3D triangular prism with depth | Ramps, wedges, angled structures |

**Depth Control:** BOX and PRISM meshes have adjustable depth (0.1 to 1.0) for creating walls of varying thickness.

**Texture Repeat:** Enable "Repeat Mode" on BOX/PRISM to tile the texture across the depth surface instead of stretching. (Option in Tab "Other" settings)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Enable the Plugin
1. Open your Godot 4.5+ project
2. Go to `Project → Project Settings → Plugins`
3. Find **"TileMapLayer3D"** and enable it
4. The **TilePlacer panel** appears in the left dock

### Step 2: Create Your Scene
1. Create a new 3D scene with a **Node3D** root
2. Add a **TileMapLayer3D** node
3. Select the TileMapLayer3D node (required for the plugin to work)

### Step 3: Load Your Tileset
1. In the **TilePlacer panel**, click **"Load Tileset"**
2. Select your tilesheet image (works best with 48x48 tiles or smaller)
3. Set **Tile Size** (e.g., 32 pixels)
4. Keep other settings at defaults to start

### Step 4: Select and Paint
1. Click a tile in the TilePlacer panel (yellow highlight = selected)
2. Click **"Enable Tiling"** button in the 3D viewport
3. You'll see a 3D grid cursor with colored axes (Red=X, Green=Y, Blue=Z)
4. **Left-click** to place tiles at the cursor position
5. Use **WASD** to move the cursor in 3D space

## 📦 Data Migration (from older versions to 0.4.0+)

TileMapLayer3D automatically migrates scenes from older versions. No manual steps required!

**When you open an old scene:**
#### 1. Open the old scene in Godot Editor
#### 2. Check the Output panel for migration messages: 
- "Migration complete! X tiles, Y with transform params" → Legacy format migrated
- "Migrated X transform entries from 4-float to 5-float format" → Transform data upgraded
- "Cleaned up X orphaned legacy chunk nodes" → Old chunk nodes removed
#### 3. Save the scene (Ctrl+S) to persist the new storage format (YOU MUST SAVE the Scene even if all Tiles appear to be gone). The tiles are not deleted; they will be rebuilt when the Scene Is Saved and reloaded. 
#### 4. Close and reopen the scene to verify:
- No migration messages should appear (already migrated)
- Tiles should display correctly and No errors in the Output panel
#### 5. After Migration, you can safely delete the Child Chunks (MultiMeshInstance3D) 
- Delete all Square, Triangle, Box or Prism Chunks (These are not needed in the Scene Tree anymore). See screenshot below. 
- After deleting the Child Chunks, you may need to SAVE and Reload the Scene again.

## ⚙️ FAQ

### Q: "I can't see the grid cursor"
**A:** Click **Enable Tiling** button and ensure TileMapLayer3D is selected with a tile chosen.

### Q: "Can I use multiple tilesets?"
**A:** Yes! Create separate TileMapLayer3D nodes, each with its own tileset.

### Q: "How do I create thick walls?"
**A:** Switch to **BOX_MESH** mode in the TilePlacer panel, then adjust the **Depth** slider.

### Q: "How do I paint interior and exterior walls?"
**A:** Use **FLAT_SQUARE** mode. You can paint tiles on opposite sides of the same wall position for double-sided walls.
